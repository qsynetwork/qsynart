            When in doubt, paint. This is a motto that teachers across most of our pathshalas have espoused to great enthusiasm from students. Thus as crayons and colour pencils are brought out with gusto during the weekly “Activity Class”, “Sit and Draw” exhibitions, or even in between lessons, we have found that art is often a means of expression when the confines of the syllabus are too restrictive. Through the paintings of the outside world we often find a glimpse of a child’s inner self - a glimpse of something within these young minds which seeks to surge forward, overcome and change.<br>
            More often than not, our students witness firsthand the necessity of questioning and changing  through the lived experiences of those who are already an intrinsic part of the pathshala. In Kalaidangi, Bankura, Santali is taught by Tallashi di, the very first graduate of her village. She brought to our notice that there is no local school that communicates via the Santali language, something that should be rectified by our pathshala. Our pathshala in Najat opened its doors from Mamata Sardar’s house. “Generation after generation, we have been fooled by people who exploit and bully us. But we will turn around,” she says. Santosh Sabar, a resident of Ranibandh, was one of the main initiators behind the local pathshala. Santosh da has not received any formal schooling himself and yet has devised the blueprint for a reservoir that will enable easy irrigation facilities for farming needs. The pathshala at Patuli Rail Colony rests amongst a line of tin-roofed structures that lie a mere few feet away from the train tracks. These tracks are where our students live, learn and grow up with relentless resilience. Teaching is frequently interrupted as the entire classroom shakes when trains pass by, and yet our volunteer-teachers walk alongside the train lines every week for Geography lessons, dance rehearsals and everything in between. <br>
            Of course the stories of learning and resistance are not limited to these few. The stories of every child, parent and stakeholder of each pathshala can be examples of larger ongoing struggles for existence that thousands in India live through everyday.<br>
            We therefore felt an art fundraiser to be a natural extension of the journey of Prithibir Pathshala, but also of the teaching-learning process that we try to inculcate there. We have thus tried to collaborate with names in the Indian art community who are some of the harshest critics of the current socio-political and economic systems and advocates of a larger need for resistance. We at QSYN hope to uphold these through our efforts to the best of our abilities, through our ground work, our visual media and through সংহতি : An Art Fundraiser for Prithibir Pathshala. We trust that you will continue to stand by us, so that our students can learn, live and grow in a more equal world.<br>
