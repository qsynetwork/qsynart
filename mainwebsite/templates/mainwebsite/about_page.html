            When in doubt, paint. This is a motto that teachers across most of our pathshalas have espoused to great enthusiasm from students. Thus crayons and colour pencils are a common sight, not only during the weekly “Activity Class” or “Sit and Draw” exhibitions, but also as a break in between lessons. This is not just as a means of escape or distraction, but because we have found that art is often a means of expression and release when the confines of the syllabus are much too restrictive. Through the paintings of home, village life, friends and family we often find a glimpse of something bigger, more powerful. A glimpse of something within these young minds which seeks to surge forward, to overcome, to change.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through Prithibir Pathshala, now 72 strong across West Bengal, we have tried to overcome the post-COVID issues of a digital divide and address the high school dropout rate. We try our best to reimagine classroom spaces creatively so that our students can not only succeed at academics but also learn about the larger world and its structures and question them wherever necessary.

            <br>
            <br>


            More often than not, this necessity of questioning and changing is witnessed first hand through the lived experiences of those who are already an intrinsic part of the pathshala. In Kalaidangi, Bankura, Tallashi di, the very first graduate of the village teaches Santali at the pathshala. She brought to our notice that there is no local school that communicates via the Santali language, something that should be rectified by our pathshala. Our pathshala in Najat opened its doors from Mamata Sardar’s house. Mamata di, the sole graduate from her village, had expressed her remorse at how dams broke and saline water entered the fields, during Amphan, making the cultivable land infertile. She encourages her students to think not only for themselves but also for the village community. “Generation after generation, we have been fooled by people who exploit and bully us. But we will turn around,” she says. Santosh Sabar, a resident of Ranibandh, was one of the main initiators behind the local pathshala. Santosh da has not received any formal schooling himself, so we were surprised when he suddenly laid out an elaborate plan after classes one day. The plan involved making a reservoir and a pump to pump up water from a small pond at the base of the hill upon which the village is located to enable easy irrigation facilities for farming needs. Those who have been to Patuli Rail Colony even once, are unlikely to forget it. The pathshala rests amongst a line of tin-roofed structures that lie a mere few feet away from the train tracks. Teaching is frequently interrupted as the entire classroom shakes when trains pass by. Yet this is the neighbourhood our students grow up in, where they share their joys and fears with one another. It is perhaps their resilience that infects our teachers too, who walk alongside the train lines every week for Geography lessons, dance rehearsals and everything in between.

            <br>

            Of course the stories of learning and resistance are not limited to these few. The stories of every child, parent and stakeholder of each pathshala can be examples of larger ongoing struggles for existence that thousands in India live through everyday.
            We therefore felt an art fundraiser to be a natural extension of not only our activities at the pathshala, but also of the teaching-learning process that we try to inculcate there. QSYN has also developed a reputation for our empathetic socio-political commentary through the visual media that we have displayed over the course of our efforts, largely due to the relentless efforts of our art and graphics team. We have thus tried to collaborate with names in the Indian art community who are some of the harshest critics of the current socio-political and economic systems and advocates of a larger need for resistance. We are trying our best to sensitise ourselves and a larger audience on topics that are very close to our heart through this fundraiser.
            In recent times there has been a heightened visibility of artists whose works are path breaking in the movement for the representation in public discourse of communities historically marginalised in India on the basis of language, religion, ethnicity, gender, etc. But these works are also intrinsic to the ongoing anti-fascist, anti-capitalist and even anti-state struggles across the country. We at QSYN hope to uphold these through our efforts to the best of our abilities, through our ground work, our visual media and through সংহতি : An Art Fundraiser for Prithibir Pathshala. We trust that you will continue to stand by us, so that our students can learn, live and grow in a more equal world.
